# Level Up IRL
Inspired by TikTok user [@kelthehydra](https://www.tiktok.com/@kelthehydra), this app aims to be an aid in gamify-ing physical activity. Whether it's losing weight, hitting a PR, or just being more active in general, Level Up IRL can help!

## Features
TBD - We're still in the planning stages!

## Screenshots
Coming Soon!

## Technologies Used
This app is built natively for both Android and iOS due to the security and other intricacies of accessing health data (like step count and heart rate) on each platform. Both projects leverage Firebase as the backend.

## Installation and Usage
TBD

## Contribution Guildelines
We are not currently accepting PRs, but please feel free to create an issue if you're having a problem!
